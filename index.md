Day 4/5 of 100 Days of Coding

Day 4 &5 of learning Python!


Day 4 I had a busy day at home with family with a lot of distractions. When I put my kids down for a nap, I built another game! This time itâ€™s a guess the number game! I was not interested in learning anything so I decided to do something that would be fun.


Day 5: I practiced building loops and functions. As I built loops and functions, I made sure to focus on the components of each part. Making sure that I understand when I build a loop what the continue, break, and else parts are, what does it mean, and why are they important to building my loops!
Once again thank you for following this journey!
